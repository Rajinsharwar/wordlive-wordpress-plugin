We use Jitsi in our plugin to enable the video calling feature. Jitsi is a free open-source video conferencing software for web & mobile. We use Jitsi API to integrate the video calling features in the plugin. Note that, our plugin currently uses the free version of Jitsi, which shows the Jitsi branding on your video calls. Some advertisements might also be shown on your calls. Please bear in mind that we are not responsible for those advertisements, those are served by Jitsi, and they are solely responsible for its legal matters. If Jitsi branding and Jitsi advertisements are really not good for your business, please drop us a mail at rajinsharwar@gmail.com, and we will deliver you a plugin that has Jitsi's premium version, no branding, and no advertisements.
